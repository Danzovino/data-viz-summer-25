## Achieving Minard's Graphical Excellence

> "[Minard's classic image] can be described and admired, but there are no compositional principles on how to create that one wonder graphic in a million.""

*Edward Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 1983*

## For The Rest of Us 

Instead, Tufte suggests:

::: {.incremental}
* "[For] more routine, workaday designs"
* "[Have] a properly chosen format and design"
* "Use words, numbers, and drawing together"
* "[D]isplay an accessible complexity of detail" 
* "Avoid content-free decoration, including chartjunk"
:::

We will revisit more of Tufte's principles throughout the course.

# Tooling & Workflow

* It is worth investing in learning your tools
* A good data visualization workflow requires good tooling and workflow
* Below we will discuss some of the tools we will use in this course and why we use them

## Required Software For This Course

## R

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* We will rely mostly on R for this course
* R can be downloaded from [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}

![R Logo](images/r.png)
:::

## git

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* `git` is a powerful tool for version control
* It allows you to 
  * track changes to your code
  * revert to previous versions of your code
  * collaborate with others on your code
  * maintain multiple branches/versions of your code
  * and more
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![git Logo](images/git.png)
:::

:::

## GitHub

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* `git` is not GitHub
* GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on code
* It is technically a remote repository for `git`
* It gives you a place to store your code and collaborate with others
* It is free for open source projects
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![GitHub Logo](images/github.png)

## Scientific Notebooks

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* Notebooks are a powerful way to work with data and do data visualization
* They allow you to embed code, text, and visualizations in a single document
* They thus allow you to easily share both the process and the results of your work
* I do not require a specific notebook system for this course, but I will be using Quarto for examples
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![Notebook Logo](images/lab-notebook.jpg)
:::

:::

## Notebooks: Quarto

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* Quarto is an open source scientific and technical publishing system
* You can create reports, websites, presentations, and books with Quarto
* This presentation is built with Quarto
* You can embed Python, R, and other code in in plaintext Quarto documents
* Quarto renders down to a document in HTML, PDF, or Word format
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![Quarto Logo](images/quarto.png)

:::

## RMarkdown

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* RMarkdown is a way to create documents that mix R code and text
* It integrates with RStudio well and has a very similar workflow to Quarto
* RMarkdown renders down to a document in HTML, PDF, or Word format; the files them selves are plain text
* Easy to store notebooks in version control with git
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![RMarkdown Logo](images/rmarkdown.png)
:::

:::

## Jupyter 

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* Jupyter is a notebook system popular with Python users
* Jupyter stores code and results in the same document (Quarto/RMarkdown render into a separate document)
* Jupyter supports R and other languages
* Jupyter stores itself as JSON (javascript object notation) files and are not as easy to diff in git
:::

## Optional/Popular Software


## RStudio

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* RStudio is a powerful IDE for R
* It is free and open source
* It helps you understand what is in your environment (e.g., variables, functions, packages, etc.)
* It also makes it easy to view your visualizations as you make them
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![RStudio Logo](images/rstudio.png)

# AI, LLMs, and Data Visualization

## AI and Data Visualization

* AI and LLMs are becoming more and more powerful
* They can help you with many data-related tasks, but require care
* They are allowed in this course, but you are responsible for checking their work

## My Philosophy

* I use LLMs in nearly all aspects of my work
* I have found that there is now less value in being able to "make computer do something" and more in high level concepts
* To that extent, in this course we will try to focus a little more on concepts and less on `ggplot2` syntax, since LLMs really can mostly solve technical visualization problems

# Project Organization & Tooling

## Before We Do Actual Visualization

* I am spending a lot of time on tools and organization
* This may seem off-topic, but I assure you it is not
* Efficient workflows and reproducible work are key to success in data science

## Benefits Of Being Organized 

* **Efficiency**: Find files quickly
* **Reproducibility**: Others can follow your work
* **Collaboration**: Team members understand your structure
* **Maintenance**: Easier to update and fix issues
* **Scalability**: Structure grows with your project

## Naming Convention Challenges

* Files need to be:
  * Easy to find
  * Easy to understand
  * Easy to sort
  * Easy to version control

* Common problems:
  * Unclear file purposes
  * Inconsistent naming
  * Missing execution order
  * Lost files in nested directories
  * Confusion about latest versions

## Course Naming Conventions

I recommend these conventions:

```
work/
â”œâ”€â”€ example_*         # Learning examples
â”œâ”€â”€ ps1_*             # Problem set 1
â”œâ”€â”€ ps2_*             # Problem set 2
â”œâ”€â”€ ps3_*             # Problem set 3
â”œâ”€â”€ final_project_*   # Final project
â”œâ”€â”€ shared_*          # Shared resources
â””â”€â”€ data/             # Data directory
```

* Prefixes indicate purpose
* Numbers show execution order
* It is a best practice to document your structure in a README

## Real-World Flexibility

* These conventions are a starting point
* Real projects often need:
  * Different structures for different teams
  * Adaptation as projects grow
  * Balance between consistency and flexibility
  * Documentation of changes

## Directory Structure Options

1. Flat Structure:
   ```
   work/
   â”œâ”€â”€ data_prep.qmd
   â”œâ”€â”€ analysis.qmd
   â””â”€â”€ data/
   ```

2. Nested Structure:
   ```
   work/
   â”œâ”€â”€ data_prep/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data_prep.qmd
   â”œâ”€â”€ analysis/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ analysis.qmd
   â””â”€â”€ data/
   ```

## The Challenge of Subdirectories

::: {.callout-warning}
## Relative Paths are Tricky!

* Files in subdirectories need to reference parent directories
* Paths like `../../data/file.csv` are:
  * Error-prone
  * Hard to maintain
  * Break when moving files
  * Confusing to read
:::

## The `.Rproj` File

* Defines your project root
* Sets the working directory
* Stores project settings
* Makes paths relative to project root
* Essential for project portability

## The `here` Package

```r
library(here)

# Instead of "../../data/file.csv"
read_csv(here("data", "file.csv"))
```

* Builds paths from project root
* Works from any subfolder
* More readable than `../`
* More maintainable

## Benefits of Good Path Management

* Paths work from anywhere
* No more `../` counting
* More maintainable
* More portable
* Easier collaboration

### When to Change Structure?

* As project complexity grows
* When working with multiple datasets
* When collaborating with others
* When sharing code with different audiences


# Getting Started with RStudio, Projects, Quarto, and `git`

## Goals

* Learn the data science workflow: RStudio, projects, Quarto, and `git`
* Set up your course workspace
* Create your first notebook

## Fork/Open the Course Repository

1. Fork the course repo on GitHub
2. In RStudio: File -> New Project -> From Version Control
3. Paste your fork URL and create

## Exploring the Example Project

1. Open `examples/project-example/`
2. Notice the structure:
   - `_quarto.yml` for configuration
   - Numbered notebooks
   - `data/` directory
   - `.gitignore`

## Setting Up Your Work Directory

1. Create new project in `work/` using RStudio (File -> New Project -> Existing Directory)
2. Select the "work" directory in the repository we just forked

I have tested this and RStudio appears to be able to handle the remote repository in the directory one higher up.


## Your Work Directory

::: {.callout-note}
## Important!

The `work/` directory is your personal workspace for **everything** in this course:

* All homework assignments
* Course projects
* Learning examples
* Your final project

**You are responsible for:**

* Keeping your work organized
* Following the naming conventions
* Maintaining a clean project structure
* Documenting your organization in README

This is your space - keep it clean and organized!
:::

## Configuring Your Project (1/2)

Let's get a file set up to work with Quarto and have data to read from.

1. Copy `example_project_quarto.yml` from `examples` to `_quarto.yml` in your new project
2. Create `data/` directory

## Configuring Your Project (2/2)

We are now going to create a file called `.gitignore` to tell git to ignore certain files.

1. Create a file called `.gitignore` (if it doesn't already exist)


## Understanding `.gitignore`

::: {.callout-warning}
## Never Commit Sensitive Data!

* `.gitignore` tells Git which files to ignore
* Critical for:
  * Protecting sensitive data
  * Preventing accidental commits
  * Keeping repositories clean
:::

## Why `.gitignore` Matters

* **Data Privacy**:
  * Health data is sensitive
  * Patient information must be protected
  * Legal requirements (HIPAA, etc.)
  * Ethical obligations

* **Repository Health**:
  * Prevents large binary files
  * Avoids temporary files
  * Keeps repository size manageable
  * Makes collaboration easier

## Our `.gitignore` Setup

```
# Data directory
data/

# R specific
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
```

* `data/`: Keeps all data files local
* `.Rproj.user`: RStudio temporary files
* `.Rhistory`: Command history
* `.RData`: R workspace files

## Creating Your First Notebook (1/4)

In RStudio:

  * Click File -> New File -> Quarto Document
  * In the dialog:
    - Title: "Data Preparation Example"
    - Author: Your Name
    - Format: HTML
    - Template: Default
  * Click "Create"
  * Save as `example_data_prep.qmd` in your `work/` directory

## Notebook Setup (2/4)

In RStudio:

  * The YAML header will be automatically created at the top of your file
  * It will look like this:

```yaml
---
title: "Data Preparation Example"
author: "Your Name"
date: "`r format(Sys.Date(), '%Y-%m-%d')`"
format: html
---
```

## Data Preparation (3/4)

Let's create the data preparation setup file.

Include this as a setup block:

```{=html}
<pre><code class="language-r">```{r setup-prep}
#| echo: false
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```</code></pre>
```

And then this to load and prepare the data:

```{=html}
<pre><code class="language-r">```{r load-data}
# Load and prepare data
mtcars_clean <- mtcars |>
  mutate(
    car_name = rownames(mtcars),
    efficiency = mpg / wt
  )

# Save processed data
write_csv(mtcars_clean, "data/mtcars_clean.csv")
```</code></pre>
```

## Render the File (4/4)

* Knit the file to see the results
* We will get two outputs:

  1. A rendered HTML file
  2. A data file stored in the `data/` directory

## Create an Analysis Notebook (1/23)

In RStudio:

  * Click File -> New File -> Quarto Document
  * In the dialog:
    - Title: "Data Analysis Example"
    - Author: Your Name
    - Format: HTML
    - Template: Default
  * Click "Create"
  * Save as `example_analysis.qmd` in your `work/` directory

## Set Up the Analysis Notebook (2/2)

```{=html}
<pre><code class="language-r">```{r setup-analysis}
#| echo: false
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```</code></pre>
```

```{=html}
<pre><code class="language-r">```{r load-processed}
# Load processed data
mtcars_clean <- read_csv("data/mtcars_clean.csv")
```</code></pre>
```

We're going to pause here, and make sure we can commit our code to GitHub. We'll come back later and make a few basic plots.

## Version Control Setup (1/2)

You should already have:
1. Forked the course repository from GitHub
2. Cloned your fork to your local machine

Now, let's set up version control in your project. Choose your preferred method:

### Option A: Using RStudio's Git Interface
1. In RStudio, go to Tools â†’ Version Control â†’ Project Setup
2. Select "Git" as the version control system
3. Click "Create Repository"
4. In the Git tab (usually in the top-right panel):
   - Click "Add" to stage all files (or select individual files)
   - Enter commit message: "Initial project setup"
   - Click "Commit"
   - Click "Push" to sync with your fork

### Option B: Using Terminal Commands
1. In the terminal:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial project setup"
   git push
   ```

## Version Control Workflow

### Option A: Using RStudio's Git Interface
1. Stage changes: Click "Add" in the Git tab
2. Commit: Enter message and click "Commit"
3. Push: Click "Push" to sync with your fork

### Option B: Using Terminal Commands
1. Stage changes: `git add .`
2. Commit: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
3. Push: `git push`

Choose whichever method you're most comfortable with as both accomplish the same thing!

## Next Steps

* Your workspace is ready in `work/`
* You can pull course updates
* Your work is version controlled
