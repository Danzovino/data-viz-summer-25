> “Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data—a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design...”

## Exemplar: Napoleon's March

## Achieving Minard's Graphical Excellence

> “[Minard's classic image] can be described and admired, but there are no compositional principles on how to create that one wonder graphic in a million.””

*Edward Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 1983*

## For The Rest of Us 

Instead, Tufte suggests:

::: {.incremental}
* “[For] more routine, workaday designs"
* "[Have] a properly chosen format and design”
* “Use words, numbers, and drawing together”
* “[D]isplay an accessible complexity of detail” 
* “Avoid content-free decoration, including chartjunk”
:::

We will revisit more of Tufte's principles throughout the course.

# Tooling & Workflow

* It is worth investing in learning your tools
* A good data visualization workflow requires good tooling and workflow
* Below we will discuss some of the tools we will use in this course and why we use them

## Required Software For This Course

## R

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* We will rely mostly on R for this course
* R can be downloaded from [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}

![R Logo](images/r.png)
:::

:::


## `ggplot2`

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* `ggplot2` is a powerful package for creating data visualizations
* It is built on the grammar of graphics
* It is a declarative grammar for data visualization
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![ggplot2 Logo](images/ggplot2.png)
:::

:::

## git

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* `git` is a powerful tool for version control
* It allows you to 
  * track changes to your code
  * revert to previous versions of your code
  * collaborate with others on your code
  * maintain multiple branches/versions of your code
  * and more
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![git Logo](images/git.png)
:::

:::

## GitHub

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* `git` is not GitHub
* GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on code
* It is technically a remote repository for `git`
* It gives you a place to store your code and collaborate with others
* It is free for open source projects
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![GitHub Logo](images/github.png)
:::

## Scientific Notebooks

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* Notebooks are a powerful way to work with data and do data visualization
* They allow you to embed code, text, and visualizations in a single document
* They thus allow you to easily share both the process and the results of your work
* I do not require a specific notebook system for this course, but I will be using Quarto for examples
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![Notebook Logo](images/lab-notebook.jpg)
:::

:::

## Notebooks: Quarto

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* Quarto is an open source scientific and technical publishing system
* You can create reports, websites, presentations, and books with Quarto
* This presentation is built with Quarto
* You can embed Python, R, and other code in your Quarto documents
* Quarto renders down to a document in HTML, PDF, or Word format; the files them selves are plain text
* Easy to store notebooks in version control with `git`
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![Quarto Logo](images/quarto.png)
:::

:::

## RMarkdown

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* RMarkdown is a way to create documents that mix R code and text
* It integrates with RStudio well and has a very similar workflow to Quarto
* RMarkdown renders down to a document in HTML, PDF, or Word format; the files them selves are plain text
* Easy to store notebooks in version control with git
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![RMarkdown Logo](images/rmarkdown.png)
:::

:::

## Jupyter 

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* Jupyter is a notebook system popular with Python users
* Jupyter stores code and results in the same document (Quarto/RMarkdown render into a separate document)
* Jupyter supports R and other languages
* Jupyter stores itself as JSON (javascript object notation) files and are not as easy to diff in git
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![Jupyter Logo](images/jupyter.png)

## Optional/Popular Software


## RStudio

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* RStudio is a powerful IDE for R
* It is free and open source
* It helps you understand what is in your environment (e.g., variables, functions, packages, etc.)
* It also makes it easy to view your visualizations as you make them
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![RStudio Logo](images/rstudio.png)
:::

:::

## Python

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* Python is a powerful general purpose programming language
* It is very popular in the data science community, especially in machine learning
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}
![Python Logo](images/python.png)
:::

:::

## LLMs

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="75%"}
* LLMs are commonly used to help with code
* Common ones used in data science are ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and GitHub's Copilot
* They can help you write code, debug code, and write documentation
* They can also make mistakes, so you cannot blindly trust their work

# AI, LLMs, and Data Visualization

## AI and Data Visualization

* AI and LLMs are becoming more and more powerful
* They can help you with many data-related tasks, but require care
* They are allowed in this course, but you are responsible for checking their work
* Data visualization is a scientific area where, to an extent, if things "look right" they are probably right

## My Philosophy

* I use LLMs in nearly all aspects of my work
* I have foound that there is now less value in being able to "make computer do something" and more in high level concepts
* To that extent, in this course we will try to focus a little more on concepts and less on `ggplot2` syntax, since LLMs really can mostly solve technical visualization problems
* Let's try it out.


## Python test

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

2 + 2

```
